This README provides instructions on how to run the Flutter app from GitHub.

Prerequisites
Before you can run the Flutter app, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Flutter SDK
Android Studio or Xcode (depending on whether you want to run the app on an Android or iOS device)
Cloning the repository
To clone the repository, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, run the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Shridhar-Atram/Disaster_Management.git


Running the app
To run the app, follow these steps:
Open Android Studio or Xcode.
Click on "Open an existing project" and select the directory where you cloned the repository.
Wait for the project to sync and install all dependencies.
Connect your Android or iOS device to your computer using a USB cable.
Ensure that USB debugging is enabled on your device.
Run the app by clicking on the "Run" button in Android Studio or Xcode.
If you don't have a physical device to test the app on, you can also use an emulator. To set up an emulator, follow the instructions in the Flutter documentation:

Set up an Android emulator
Set up an iOS simulator
Conclusion
That's it! You should now be able to run the Flutter app from GitHub on your device or emulator. If you encounter any issues, please consult the Flutter documentation or open an issue on the repository.
